            I am freelance developer, currently living in Brno, Czechia. With 6 years of active frontend/backend development I consider myself as senior experienced.
            Since the beginning of my career my primary focus (and passion) is e-commerce. I am fond of tailor made solutions with page speed and UI/UX optimizations in mind.
            I have experiences with almost every part of project development - from customer idea, through analysis and prototyping to programming, coding and customer care / project management.

            Currently working as front-end team leader in mid sized company, specialized on tailor-made e-commerce solutions.
